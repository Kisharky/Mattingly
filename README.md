# Profit Lens — AI-Powered Warehouse Profit Intelligence
### Mattingly AI & Operations Hackathon 2026 · Kishan Gowda

---

## One-Line Summary

Profit Lens finds every dollar Mattingly is losing on warehouse operations, turns each loss into a role-owned action ticket, and tracks live delivery against a recovery target — powered by a hybrid AI architecture that routes reasoning tasks to NVIDIA Nemotron and conversation to Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B.

---

## The Problem

Mattingly's standard reporting shows every customer at ~96% gross margin. That number is structurally misleading — it ignores the true cost of picking.

The ABC (Activity-Based Costing) engine calculates:

| Metric | Value | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| True pick cost | **$0.265/pick** | Conservative floor (4 days missing T&A data treated as zero cost) |
| True pick cost (strict) | **$0.284/pick** | Removes the 4 incomplete days from calculation |
| Charged rate range | **$0.12–$0.17/pick** | Every customer is being served below true cost |
| Total identified opportunity | **$2.66M/year** | $1.86M pricing leakage + $0.80M operational exposure |
| 9-month recovery target | **$1.15M** | Achievable through repricing and re-billing — no customer exits |

**Operational exposure breakdown:**
- F014 Delta exception-handling labour drain: **$446K/year** — premium labour absorbed without billing recovery
- F015 Urgent-order throughput penalty: **$349K/year** — disruption cost from non-standard fulfilment patterns

> **Why two pick costs?** The conservative $0.265 is the negotiating floor — it's harder to dispute and still proves every customer is below cost. The strict $0.284 is used for internal modelling. All commercial conversations use $0.265.

## How It Works

```
UPLOAD → ANALYSE → TICKET → ACT → RECOVER
```

| Stage | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **UPLOAD** | Drop the warehouse Excel file. The engine resolves sheet names dynamically — handles renamed or reordered tabs, concatenates monthly variants (M1/M2/M3...), and derives the annualisation factor from the months actually present. |
| **ANALYSE** | ABC engine calculates true pick cost, compares to each customer's contracted rate, identifies exception volumes, and flags data gaps — all from the raw dataset. |
| **TICKET** | Every gap becomes a finding ticket with a dollar value, priority, assigned role, and status. 10 pre-built findings load from `data/findings.json` on first run. Live upload regenerates from the actual dataset. |
| **ACT** | Role-filtered queues: CEO approves and tracks, Commercial Lead reprices and rebills, Site Manager closes data gaps. AI suggests the single highest-impact action for each role based on live ticket state. |
| **RECOVER** | Closing a ticket moves the live recovery bar. The Impact Tracker shows which actions have converted to measurable profit improvement — closing the loop from finding to value. |

## AI Architecture

Profit Lens uses a hybrid LLM setup with deliberate model routing:

| Task | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Suggested Next Action** (Dashboard) | NVIDIA Nemotron | Multi-step reasoning over ranked tickets + role context |
| **Ticket Enhancement** (ROOT CAUSE / NEXT STEP) | NVIDIA Nemotron | Structural diagnosis — reasoning model outperforms chat model here |
| **Notifications Situational Brief** | NVIDIA Nemotron | Cross-ticket dependency reasoning |
| **Management Q&A chatbot** | Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B | Fast, conversational, pre-computed numbers in system prompt |
| **Inline role Q&A** (Dashboard) | Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B | Sub-second response for quick queries |

**Graceful degradation:** NVIDIA unavailable → falls back to Groq. Both unavailable → static pre-computed fallback. The app never goes blank.

**Security constraints hard-coded in architecture:**
- LLMs never analyse raw Excel data
- LLMs never generate financial findings
- LLMs never send external reports or trigger actions outside the app
- All dollar figures flow from `engine.get_headline_figures()` → `_HF` dict → system prompt

---

## Quick Start

```bash
cd "Phase 3 Tool"
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Reset DB before a demo (puts Bravo ticket into "In Progress" — the live demo state)
python reload_db.py

streamlit run app.py
```

The app auto-loads 10 pre-built findings from `data/findings.json` on first run.

> **Note:** Run from the `Phase 3 Tool/` directory. SQLite cannot write to some network-mapped drives — if you get a disk I/O error, copy the folder to a local drive first.

### API Keys (optional — AI degrades gracefully without them)

Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (already gitignored):

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY   = "your-groq-key"       # free at console.groq.com
NVIDIA_API_KEY = "your-nvidia-key"     # free at build.nvidia.com
```

Without keys: all pre-computed insights still display. AI cards fall back to role-specific static text. Nothing goes blank.

## Pages

### 1. Dashboard
Role-filtered view — the entire page changes based on the sidebar Role selector:

- **CEO** — recovery progress bar, portfolio health heatmap, decisions requiring sign-off, monthly cadence checklist, Best/Likely/Worst recovery scenarios, tiered pricing worked example
- **Commercial Lead** — pricing action queue ranked by dollar impact, weekly cadence, evidence-gathering workflow
- **Site Manager** — data quality checklist with today's date, exception rates by customer, daily ops cadence, F007 labour gap status

**AI Suggested Next Action** at the top of each view: Nemotron reads the live ticket queue and surfaces one ACTION / WHY / NEXT STEP tailored to that role's decision authority.

### 2. Customer Profitability
30 customers ranked by true ABC margin. Each card shows true margin, reported margin, root cause, and a recommendation (REPRICE / REBILL / MONITOR / REVIEW).

**Key accounts:**

| Customer | True Margin | Key Issue | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bravo FMCG | 29% | $0.12/pick vs $0.265 true cost | Reprice to $0.19 — Month 1 pilot |
| Delta Manufacturing | 19.5% | Below-cost rate + 14% exception rate | Reprice + rebill exceptions — Month 2 |
| Charlie Retail | 22% | $68K unbilled pick exceptions | Issue credit note and rebill — immediate |

**Methodology caveat:** Margins are a pricing-and-billing view, not a measured-per-customer P&L. Missing input: Product ID join key on transaction records (top data quality priority).

### 3. Action Queue
Every finding as a prioritised ticket. Expandable — shows description, dollar impact, owner, status dropdown, and an AI Enhance button (Nemotron: ROOT CAUSE + NEXT STEP). Filtered by role.

### 4. Impact Tracker
Live recovery progress against the $1.15M target. Cumulative value by month across the 9-month roadmap.

### 5. Operations
Picks-per-hour productivity, exception volume by customer, bottleneck analysis.

### 6. Information Gaps
Data quality scorecard — confidence ratings for each finding, what's blocking full quantification, who owns resolution.

**CEO Monthly Data Quality Priorities:**
1. 🔴 OPEN — Product ID join key on transaction records (IT / Data Engineering)
2. 🟡 OPEN — F007 4-day labour gap in timesheet data (Site Manager)
3. 🟢 VERIFIED — Seasonality factor confirmed from 6 months of data

### 7. AI Assistant (Management Q&A)
Full conversational chatbot on Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B. System prompt built from live `_HF` headline figures — cites actual engine output, never hardcoded numbers. Role-specific context loads on entry.

### 8. Load Data (Live Upload)
Upload the warehouse Excel file to regenerate all findings from the actual dataset. Sheet resolver handles renamed or reordered tabs. Upload guard alerts if pre-baked tickets are still loaded after a fresh upload.

### 9. Tickets (Admin)
Database view — all tickets, raw status, dollar impact. Reset to default or reload from findings.json.

## Engine Design

- **Priority-ordered keyword resolver** — "customer pric" beats "pric" so "Customer Pricing" wins over "Standard Pricing" without ambiguity
- **Dynamic annualisation** — `annualise_factor = 12.0 / months_in_data` derived from actual sheet count
- **Multi-month concatenation** — M1/M2/M3 activity sheets stacked and treated as one dataset
- **Clear error messages** — missing sheets surface a human-readable error naming exactly what was expected
- **Named constants** — `OPS_EXPOSURE_F014_F015 = 446_000 + 349_000` with comments; no bare magic numbers
- **Single source of truth** — `get_headline_figures()` returns `_HF` dict; every dollar figure in the UI, AI system prompt, and fallback KB reads from `_HF`, never from a hardcoded literal

## Recovery Roadmap

| Month | Milestone | Cumulative Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bravo FMCG repricing pilot ($144K/yr) | $144K |
| 2 | Delta Manufacturing evidence + exception rebilling | $272K |
| 3 | Delta repricing + Charlie Retail rebill ($68K) | $416K |
| 6 | Sites 2–3 onboarding | $850K |
| 9 | Full portfolio — all 30 customers on corrected rates | $1.15M |

| Scenario | Recovery | Assumption |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Best | $1.4M | All customers accept new rates; no churn |
| 🟡 Likely | $1.15M | 80% acceptance; 2 customers negotiate down |
| 🔴 Worst | $0.75M | 50% acceptance; 3-month delay on Delta |

## Why This Wins

Most hackathon submissions find the problem. Profit Lens closes the loop:

1. **Finding → specific dollar amount**, not a directional observation
2. **Ticket → owned by a named role** with a status and a deadline
3. **AI action → Nemotron reasons over live ticket state**, not a generic recommendation
4. **Recovery tracking → the bar moves when tickets close**, proving ROI in the session
5. **Resilient ingest → drop any renamed Excel file**, it works
6. **Graceful AI degradation → no keys, no internet**, app still runs with full pre-computed insight

The architecture separates what AI is good at (reasoning over structure) from what it must never do (generate financial numbers). That boundary is enforced in code, not policy.
